# Temperature Converter

This is an interactive and responsive **Temperature Converter** web application that allows users to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and provides a clean, elegant user interface with smooth animations and transitions.

## 🖥️ Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the project [here](https://bhavana-s-ui.github.io/DigitalBhemIntern/).

## 🌟 Features

- Convert temperatures between **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Kelvin**.
- Simple, intuitive, and **responsive** design that works across all devices (desktop and mobile).
- Smooth **animations** and transitions for a modern look and feel.
- **Error handling** to prompt users to input a valid temperature.
- Includes a **Reset** button to clear the input and start fresh.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for temperature conversion and interactivity.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Enter the temperature** in the input field.
2. **Select the unit** (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) by choosing the corresponding radio button.
3. Click the **"Convert"** button to see the converted temperature values in other units.
4. Click **"Reset"** to clear the input and try again.

### Conversion Formulas Used

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**: \( °F = (°C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32 \)
- **Celsius to Kelvin**: \( K = °C + 273.15 \)
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: \( °C = (°F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \)
- **Fahrenheit to Kelvin**: First convert to Celsius, then convert to Kelvin.
- **Kelvin to Celsius**: \( °C = K - 273.15 \)
- **Kelvin to Fahrenheit**: Convert Kelvin to Celsius first, then convert to Fahrenheit.
